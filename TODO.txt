- Figure out CSS
	- use a template (get includes)
		- Maybe use post css (only need to run it as a transform)
	- minify in transform
	- CSS variables

- FIGURE OUT JS
	- Want just handwritten stuff, keep inclusions minimal, should be served from CDN
	- should be minified JS in transform
	- Don't think we need to template it, can be treated as asset?
