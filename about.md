# About Me

I am a Sydney native who has always had a passion for technology. I graduated from the University of Sydney with a Comp Sci/Math double major.

My first job out of Uni was working at Google on the MyMaps platform in Silicon Valley. After Google I came back to Sydney to work at Canva on their image marketplace. Since then I've taken work in the construction and mental health space helping small teams with their web apps.

I've worked across a lot of projects both big and small in my career and have come to believe in a set of principles that help ensure technological solutions are successful:

### Humans First

Too often people see technology as an ends itself rather than as a tool to solve a problem. Technology should be solving human problems first and foremost and this should be the first thought when implementing soilutions.

### KISS

A simple and elegant solution is the benchmark on which other solutions should be measured. Unneeded complexity creates unecessary burdans on users, developers and maintaners. Complexity should evolve into solutions over time to solve real problems.

### Open Technology

The web is built on open technology. Every software product in the world has benefited from free and open source software that people have contributed to over the last half a century. I strongly believe in leveraging existing open technology and giving back to the free and open source software communities.
