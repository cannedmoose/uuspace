# Keep your site running smoothly

Infrastructure is the backbone of your website. I can make sure yours is sustainably fulfilling your needs.

## Domain management and hosting

Need a new domain or to tweak your DNS settings? Domain management is simple until it isn't. I can help you navigate setting up a new domain, email, configuring subdomains and site verifications or even switch hosting no matter who your registerer is.

## Database update, migration and export

I have years of experience in traditional relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL datastores (MongoDB, Redis). I can help setup, transfer, maintain and extract value from your data.
