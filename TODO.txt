Thoughts on cold opening:

HMM SO maybe "I make unique online spaces" turns into "u-u.space" as you scroll?


Like a neon sign flashing on
Start with u lit up
the other letter flicker on
everything is lit up

Use shadows to look like light (initally it's just u casting small light, then everything whole page lights up)
Animation should only show first time they visit
Afterwards we skip right to showing the full page with regular header
have a light switch in the footer? This will turn lights off again, next time they visit animation will play
