# About Me

I was born and raised in Sydney, am ex-google and ex-canva. Prefer working with smaller teams. Have come to believe in a set of principles to guide technolgy solutions:

### Humans First

Too often people see technology as an ends itself rather than as a tool to solve a problem. Technology should be solving human problems first and foremost and this should be the first thought when implementing soilutions.

### KISS

A simple and elegant solution is the benchmark on which other solutions should be measured. Unneeded complexity creates unecessary burdans on users, developers and maintaners. Complexity should evolve into solutions over time to solve real problems.

### Open Technology

The web is built on open technology. Every software product in the world has benefited from free and open source software that people have contributed to over the last half a century. I strongly believe in leveraging existing open technology and giving back to the free and open source software communities.
