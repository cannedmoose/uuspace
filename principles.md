# Principles

Every project is different and in my time working with technology I've seen project succeses and failures ranging from single people executing grand visions to multibillion dollar company screw ups. I've come to believe in a set of principles to guide development to give projects the best chance of success.

## Humans First

Technology should be solving human problems first and foremost. Too often people see technology as an ends itself rather than as a tool to solve a problem. When defining a problem and considering solutions we should consider the people that are affected and base the choice of technology on that.

## KISS

A simple and elegant solution is the benchmark on which other solutions should be measured. Unneeded complexity creates unecessary burdans on users, developers and maintaners. Complexity should evolve into solutions over time to solve real problems rather than be planned in from the get-go.

## Open Technology

The web is built on open technology. Every software product in the world has benefited from free and open source software that people have contributed to over the last half a century. The majority of these contributions are unpaid.

I strongly believe in leveraging existing open technology and giving back to the free and open source software communities.
